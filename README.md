# do-op - DigitalOcean Operations Toolkit

A comprehensive, multi-language toolkit for the DigitalOcean API built from the official OpenAPI v3.0 specification. This project provides type-safe client libraries and CLI tools across multiple programming languages.

## 🚀 Features

- **Complete API Coverage**: Built from the official DigitalOcean OpenAPI spec (291 endpoints, 512 operations)
- **Multi-Language Support**: Native implementations in Go, JavaScript/TypeScript, Rust, C, Ruby, and Swift
- **Type Safety**: Full type definitions and schema validation for all API operations
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line interfaces for common DigitalOcean operations
- **Modern Architecture**: Built with current best practices for each language ecosystem
