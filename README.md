# do-op - Digital Ocean OPs.

This project will analyze the public DigitalOcean API spec and generate tools to use it in various languages.

## Project Structure

The project is organized by programming language, with each language having its own directory:

- `go/` - Go language client libraries and tools
- `js/` - JavaScript/TypeScript client libraries and tools  
- `rust/` - Rust language client libraries and tools

Each language directory will contain generated client libraries, tools, and examples for interacting with the DigitalOcean API.
